# PostgreSQL-to-MongoDB-Pipeline---Rust

Make sure to replace placeholders such as your_postgres_table, your_mongo_db, and your_mongo_collection with your actual PostgreSQL table name, MongoDB database name, and MongoDB collection name.

Install Rust:
If you haven't installed Rust on your machine, you can do so by following the instructions on the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

You need to include the necessary dependencies in your Cargo.toml file. Here are the dependencies you'll need:
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tokio-postgres = "0.7"
mongodb = "2.0"

This includes the tokio runtime for asynchronous programming, the tokio-postgres crate for PostgreSQL database access, and the mongodb crate for MongoDB database access.

To specify these dependencies:
Create a Cargo.toml file in the same directory as your Rust source code (data_conversion.rs). This file is in the repository so no need to create a new one.

After you've added these dependencies, when you run cargo run, Cargo will automatically download and build the required crates for you.

Remember to replace the version numbers with the latest versions available at the time you are running the main code.

After all this you can run the data_conversion.rs file.
